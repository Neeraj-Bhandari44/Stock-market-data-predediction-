About the project:
Predicting the right products can bring great benefits to suppliers and vendors. It is often stated that predictions have more stress than probabilities, that is, they can be predicted by carefully examining the history of individual stocks. Machine learning is a good way to represent this process. The business value it estimates is close to tangible value, so be accurate. The incorporation of machine learning into the field of product prediction has attracted the attention of many studies due to its high quality and accuracy. An important part of machine learning is data usage. The data set should be as specific as possible because small changes in the data can lead to large changes in the results. This project used supervised machine learning on data obtained from TATA NSE Global Beverages Limited. This data includes the following variables: Date, Opening Price, Highest Price, Lowest Price, Last Price, Closing Price, Total Volume, Turnover (Lacs). Opening price, closing price, lowest price and highest price are the differences between purchase prices at different times, and the list is almost simple. The model is then tested on test data. Regression models and LSTM models are widely used for this hypothesis. While regression deals with reducing errors, LSTM helps in long-term retention of data and results. Finally, a graph of the price change during the day (inverse model-based model) and the actual and predicted price (LSTM-based model) is prepared.
